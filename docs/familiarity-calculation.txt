Calculate familiarity

= Area Responsibility + History Frequently Delivery + Compactness of Area of Actual Delivery Shipment

Area Responsibility
= 1 if the area is in the Responsibility
= 0.5 if the area is not in the Responsibility but connected to the area is in the Responsibility
= 0 if the area is not in the Responsibility and not connected to the area is in the Responsibility


History Frequently Delivery
= The summation of (The number of shipments of the area / The number of shipments of the most visit area)


Compactness of Area of Actual Delivery Shipment
= 1 - (Area of Actual Delivery Shipment / Area of All Shipment)



-- Calculate Km2 of a polygon stores in GCS WGS84
-- by default ST_Area returns the calculation in meters so the appropriate conversion was applied
-- fir_area_20131205 was the example table used
-- the spatial data was in a geom field so geom::geography was added

SELECT ST_Area(geom::geography)/1000000  as sqKM from fir_area_20131205
